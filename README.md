### Mock data service

The project uses a small data service located in `src/services/dataService.ts` to
provide application data. When the `VITE_USE_MOCKS` environment variable is set
to `true` (the default), the service returns arrays from the mock files under
`src/data` and `src/mocks`. Set `VITE_USE_MOCKS=false` to disable these mocks â€“
the functions will then throw errors until real API calls are implemented.
This design makes it easy to replace the mock logic with actual HTTP requests in
the future.
